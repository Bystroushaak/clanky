    <title>Microblog: Stephen Wolfram's infrastructure</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Iâ€™ve come across interesting post from Stephen Wolfram <a href="https://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/">Seeking the Productive Life: Some Details of My Personal Infrastructure</a>. As the title says, it is about his infrastructure and habits around storing and organizing information.</p>
<!-- break -->
<p>He describes all kind of automation around data streams he is creating, from email to number of keys pressed on keyboard. I was impressed how he uses his company and Wolfram language to create structured API for the world around him.</p>
<p>I am also trying to organize my personal wikis and infrastructure and habits about creating and maintaining all kind of personal databases and this post was really inspirational.</p>
<p>Do you know any similar posts? I find fascinating to read about other people workflow, for example Warren Ellis has a <a href="http://orbitaloperations.com/">series of newsletters</a> about other people desk environments. Sadly, this newsletter is not public, but you can see what I mean in the second part of this blogpost: <a href="https://ricardoluna.home.blog/2019/03/25/from-the-republic-of-newsletters/">from the republic of newsletters</a>.</p>
